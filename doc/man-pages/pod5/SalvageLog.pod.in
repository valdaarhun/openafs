SalvageLog - Traces Salvager operations

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The F<SalvageLog> file records a trace of Salvager (B<salvager> process)
operations on the local machine and describes any error conditions it
encounters.

If the F<SalvageLog> file does not already exist in the F</usr/afs/logs>
directory when the Salvager starts, the process creates it and writes
initial start-up messages to it. If there is an existing file, the
Salvager renames is to F<SalvageLog.old>, overwriting the existing
F<SalvageLog.old> file if it exists.

When the Salvager is salvaging an entire file server, it creates a
separate log file for each partition it starts salvaging. That file will
be named F<SalvageLog.I<job>> where I<job> is a job number that will
normally (but is not guaranteed to) correspond to the index of the
partition being salvaged. Once salvaging of all partitions is complete,
the Salvager will accumulate all the partition-specific log files, append
them to F<SalvageLog>, and then remove the partition-specific files.

The file is in ASCII format. Administrators listed in the
F</usr/afs/etc/UserList> file can use the B<bos getlog> command to display
its contents. Alternatively, log onto the file server machine and use a
text editor or a file display command such as the UNIX B<cat> command. By
default, the mode bits on the F<SalvageLog> file grant the required C<r>
(read) permission to all users.

The Salvager records operations only as it completes them, and cannot
recover from failures by reviewing the file. The log contents are useful
for administrative evaluation of process failures and other problems.
