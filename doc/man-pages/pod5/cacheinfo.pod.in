=head1 NAME

cacheinfo - Defines configuration parameters for the Cache Manager

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The F<cacheinfo> file defines configuration parameters for the Cache
Manager, which reads the file as it initializes.

The file contains a single line of ASCII text and must reside in the
F</usr/vice/etc> directory. Use a text editor to create it during initial
configuration of the client machine; the required format is as follows:

   <mount>:<cache>:<size>

where

=over 4

=item <mount>

Names the local disk directory at which the Cache Manager mounts the AFS
namespace. It must exist before the B<afsd> program runs. The conventional
value is F</afs>. Using any other value prevents traversal of pathnames
that begin with F</afs> (such as pathnames to files in foreign cells that
do use the conventional name).  The B<-mountdir> argument to the B<afsd>
command overrides this value.

=item <cache>

Names the local disk directory to use as a cache. It must exist before the
B<afsd> program runs. The standard value is F</usr/vice/cache>, but it is
acceptable to substitute a directory on a partition with more available
space. Although the Cache Manager ignores this field when configuring a
memory cache, a value must always appear in it. The B<-cachedir> argument
to the B<afsd> command overrides this value.

=item <size>

Specifies the cache size as a number of 1-kilobyte blocks. Larger caches
generally yield better performance, but a disk cache must not exceed 90%
of the space available on the cache partition (85% for AIX systems), and a
memory cache must use no more than 25% of available machine memory.

The B<-blocks> argument to the afsd command overrides this value. To reset
cache size without rebooting on a machine that uses disk caching, use the
B<fs setcachesize> command. To display the current size of a disk or
memory cache between reboots, use the B<fs getcacheparms> command.

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following example cacheinfo file mounts the AFS namespace at F</afs>,
establishes a disk cache in the F</usr/vice/cache> directory, and defines
cache size as 50,000 1-kilobyte blocks.

   /afs:/usr/vice/cache:50000
