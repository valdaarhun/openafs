=head1 NAME

afszcm.cat - Error message catalog for debugging the Cache Manager

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The F<afszcm.cat> file is a message catalog for the Cache Manager. The
B<fstrace dump> command interpreter uses it in conjunction with the
standard UNIX catalog utilities to translate Cache Manager operation codes
into character strings as it writes traces in the B<fstrace> trace log,
which makes the log more readable.

The conventional location for the file is the F</usr/vice/etc/C/>
directory. It can be placed in another directory if the NLSPATH and LANG
environment variables are set appropriately.
