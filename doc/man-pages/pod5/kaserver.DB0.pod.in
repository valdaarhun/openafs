=head1 NAME

kaserver.DB0, kaserver.DBSYS1 - The Authentication Database and associated log

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The F<kaserver.DB0> file contains the Authentication Database, which
records server encryption keys and an encrypted form of all user
passwords. The Authentication Server (B<kaserver> process) uses the
information in the database to enable secured communications between AFS
server and client processes.

The F<kaserver.DBSYS1> file is a log file in which the Authentication
Server logs each database operation before performing it. When an
operation is interrupted, the Authentication Server replays the log to
complete the operation.

Both files are in binary format and reside in the F</usr/afs/db> directory
on each of the cell's database server machines. When the Authentication
Server starts or restarts on a given machine, it establishes a connection
with its peers and verifies that its copy of the database matches the copy
on the other database server machines. If not, the Authentication Servers
call on AFS's distributed database technology, Ubik, to distribute to all
of the machines the copy of the database with the highest version number.

Always use the commands in the kas suite to administer the Authentication
Database. It is advisable to create an archive copy of the database on a
regular basis, using a tool such as the UNIX B<tar> command.

=head1 CAUTIONS

The Authentication Server is obsolete and is provided only for sites that
need to use it while preparing for a migration to Kerberos KDC. It will be
removed in a future version of OpenAFS.
