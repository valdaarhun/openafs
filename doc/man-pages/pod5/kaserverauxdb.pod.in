=head1 NAME

kaserverauxdb - Records failed authentication attempts

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The file F<kaserverauxdb> records failed authentication attempts for the
local Authentication Server. The server creates it automatically in the
F</usr/afs/local> directory by default; use the B<-localfiles> argument to
the B<kaserver> command to specify an alternate directory.

The F<kaserverauxdb> file is an internal database used by the
Authentication Server to prevent access by users who have exceeded the
limit on failed authentication attempts defined in their Authentication
Database entry. The Authentication Server refuses further attempts to
authenticate to an account listed in the database until either an AFS
system administrator issues the B<kas unlock> command to unlock the
account, or the timeout period defined in the user's Authentication
Database entry passes.

The F<kaserverauxdb> file is in binary format, so its contents are not
directly accessible. However, the output from the B<kas examine> command
reports an account's maximum number of failed attempts, the lockout time,
and whether the account is currently locked.

=head1 CAUTIONS

The Authentication Server is obsolete and is provided only for sites that
need to use it while preparing for a migration to Kerberos KDC. It will be
removed in a future version of OpenAFS.
