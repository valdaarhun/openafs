=head1 NAME

salvage.lock - Prevents multiple simultaneous salvage operations on a partition

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The F<salvage.lock> file guarantees that only one Salvager (B<salvager>
process) runs at a time on a file server machine (the single process can
fork multiple subprocesses to salvage multiple partitions in parallel). As
the Salvager initializes, it creates the empty (zero-length) file in the
F</usr/afs/local> directory and invokes the B<flock> system call on it. It
removes the file when it completes the salvage operation. Because the
Salvager must lock the file to run, only one Salvager can run at a time.
