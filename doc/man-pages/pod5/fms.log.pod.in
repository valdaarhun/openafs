=head1 NAME

fms.log - Records output from the fms command

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The F<fms.log> file records the output generated by the B<fms>
command. The output includes two numbers that can appear in a tape
device's entry in the F</usr/afs/backup/tapeconfig> file on the Tape
Coordinator machine to which the tape device is attached:

=over 4

=item *

The capacity in bytes of the tape in the device.

=item *

The size in bytes of the end-of-file (EOF) marks (often referred to simply
as I<filemarks>) that the tape device writes.

=back

When transferring the numbers recorded in this file to the F<tapeconfig>
file, adjust them as specified in L<tapeconfig(5)>, to improve Tape
Coordinator performance during dump operations.

If the F<fms.log> file does not already exist in the current working
directory, the B<fms> command interpreter creates it.  In this case, the
directory's mode bits must grant the C<rwx> (read, write, and execute)
permissions to the issuer of the command. If there is an existing file,
the command interpreter overwrites it, so the file's mode bits need to
grant only the B<w> permission to the issuer of the B<fms> command.  The
B<fms> command interpreter also writes similar information to the standard
output stream as it runs.

The file is in ASCII format. To display its contents, log onto the client
machine and use a text editor or a file display command such as the UNIX
B<cat> command. By default, the mode bits on the F<fms.log> file grant the
required C<r> permission only to the owner (which is the local superuser
C<root> by default).

=head1 OUTPUT

The first few lines of the file provide a simple trace of the B<fms>
command interpreter's actions, specifying (for example) how many blocks it
wrote on the tape. The final two lines in the file specify tape capacity
and filemark size in bytes, using the following format:

   Tape capacity is <tape_size> bytes
   File marks are <filemark_size> bytes

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following example of the fms.log file specifies that the tape used
during the execution of the B<fms> command had a capacity of 2,136,604,672
bytes, and that the tape device writes filemarks of size 1,910,220 bytes.

   fms test started
   wrote 130408 blocks
   Tape capacity is 2136604672 bytes
   File marks are 1910220 bytes
