=head1 NAME

NoAuth - Disables authorization checking

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The F<NoAuth> file, if present in a server machine's F</usr/afs/local>
directory, indicates to the AFS server processes running on the machine
that it is not necessary to perform authorization checking. They perform
any action for any user who logs into the machine's local file system or
issues a remote command that affects the machine's AFS server functioning,
such as commands from the AFS command suites. Because failure to check
authorization exposes the machine's AFS server functionality to attack,
this file should never be created.  It was once necessary to use
NoAuth when initializing a new cell, but B<-localauth> and other
tooling means that new cells can be running securely from the start.
As such, this file is just a historical vestige.

The absence of the file means that the AFS server processes perform
authorization checking, verifying that the issuer of a command has the
required privilege.

Create the file in one of the following ways:

=over 4

=item *

By issuing the bosserver initialization command with the B<-noauth> flag,
if the Basic OverSeer (BOS) Server is not already running.

=item *

By issuing the B<bos setauth> command with off as the value for the
B<-authrequired> argument, if the BOS Server is already running.

=back

To remove the file, issue the B<bos setauth> command with C<on> as the
value for the B<-authrequired> argument.

The file's contents, if any, are ignored; an empty (zero-length) file is
effective.
