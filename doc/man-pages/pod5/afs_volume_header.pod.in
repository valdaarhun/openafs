=head1 NAME

afs_volume_header - Represents an AFS volume

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The F<VI<vol_ID>.vol> file is the header file for the AFS volume with
volume ID I<vol_ID>. There is one such file for each volume stored on an
AFS server (F</vicep>) partition. The header file stores information that
includes the volume's name, ID number, type (read/write, read-only, or
backup), size and status (online, offline, or busy). To display
information from the header file, use the B<vos listvol> or B<vos examine>
command.

The header file points to, but does not contain, the actual data in the
volume. It is not possible to access the AFS data except by mounting the
volume in the AFS filespace and reading its contents through the Cache
Manager.
