=head1 NAME

UserList - Defines privileged administrators

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The F<UserList> file lists the AFS usernames of the system administrators
authorized to issue privileged B<bos>, B<vos>, and B<backup> commands that
affect the local server machine or the volumes housed on it. It must
reside in the F</usr/afs/etc> directory on every server machine.

Although the F<UserList> file is in ASCII format, do not use a text editor
to alter it. Instead always use the appropriate commands from the B<bos>
command suite:

=over 4

=item *

The B<bos adduser> command to add a user to the file.

=item *

The B<bos listusers> command to display the contents of the file.

=item *

The B<bos removeuser> command to remove a user from the file.

=back

Although it is theoretically possible to list different administrators in
the F<UserList> files on different server machines, doing so can cause
unanticipated authorization failures and is not recommended. In cells that
use the Update Server to distribute the contents of the F</usr/afs/etc>
directory, it is customary to edit only the copy of the file stored on the
system control machine. Otherwise, edit the file on each server machine
individually.
