=head1 NAME

FORCESALVAGE - Forces salvage of entire partition

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The F<FORCESALVAGE> file, if present on an AFS server partition (that is,
in a F</vicep> directory), signals that the Salvager must salvage the
entire partition. The AFS-modified version of the B<fsck> program creates
the empty (zero-length) file when it discovers corruption on the
partition. The Salvager removes the file when it completes the salvage
operation.

When the File Server detects the presence of the file on a partition on
which it is attaching volumes, it stops, detaches any volumes that are
already attached, and exits after recording a message in the
F</usr/afs/logs/FileLog> file. The Bos Server then invokes the Salvager to
salvage the partition.
