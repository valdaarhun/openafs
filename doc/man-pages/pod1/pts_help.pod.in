=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<pts help> command displays the complete online help entry (short
description and syntax statement) for each command operation code
specified by the B<-topic> argument. If the B<-topic> argument is omitted,
the output includes the first line (name and short description) of the
online help entry for every B<pts> command.

To list every pts command whose name or short description includes a
specified keyword, use the B<pts apropos> command.

=item B<-topic> <I<help string>>+

Indicates each command for which to display the complete online help
entry. Omit the B<pts> part of the command name, providing only the
operation code (for example, specify C<membership>, not C<pts
membership>). If this argument is omitted, the output briefly describes
every B<pts> command.

=item B<-help>

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are
ignored.
