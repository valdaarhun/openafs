=head1 SYNOPSIS

=for html
<div class="synopsis">

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<fs messages> command controls whether the Cache Manager displays
status and warning messages on user screens, the client machine console,
on both, or on neither.

There are two types of Cache Manager messages:

=over 4

=item *

User messages provide user-level status and warning information, and the
Cache Manager directs them to user screens.

=item *

Console messages provide system-level status and warning information, and
the Cache Manager directs them to the client machine's designated console.

=back

Disabling messaging completely is not recommended, because the messages
provide useful status and warning information.
