=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<fs setcachesize> command changes the number of kilobyte blocks of
local disk space available to the Cache Manager for its data cache, on
machines that use a disk cache. The command is not operative on machines
that use a memory cache.

To return the cache size to the default value specified in the third field
of the local F</usr/vice/etc/cacheinfo> file, provide a value of C<0> to
the B<-blocks> argument.

To return the cache size to the value set when the machine was last
rebooted, use the B<-reset> flag instead of the B<-blocks> argument. This
is normally the amount specified in the F<cacheinfo> file, unless the
B<-blocks> argument was included on the B<afsd> command to override the
B<cacheinfo> value.

To display the current cache size and amount of cache in use, for both
disk and memory caches, use the B<fs getcacheparms> command.

=head1 CAUTIONS

This command is not operative on machines using a memory cache, and
results in an error message. To change memory cache size, edit the
B<cacheinfo> file and reboot, or reboot and provide the B<-blocks>
argument to the B<afsd> command.

On machines using a disk cache, do not set the cache size to exceed 85% to
90% of the actual disk space available for the cache directory. The cache
implementation itself requires a small amount of space on the partition.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-blocks> <I<size>>

Specifies the amount of disk space available for the Cache Manager to
devote to the cache.  The size should be a positive integer followed by an
optional suffix: C<K> for kibibytes (1024 bytes, the default), C<M> for
mebibytes (1024 kibibytes), C<G> for gibibytes (1024 mebibytes), and C<T>
for tebibytes (1024 gibibytes).  Provide a value of C<0> to set cache size
to the default specified in the F<cacheinfo> file.

=item B<-reset>

Returns the cache size to the value set when the machine was last
booted. This agrees with the value in the F<cacheinfo> file unless the
B<-blocks> argument was used on the B<afsd> command.

=item B<-help>

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are
ignored.

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following command sets the disk cache size to 25000 kilobyte blocks.

   % fs setcachesize -blocks 25000

Both of the following commands reset the disk cache size to the value in
the F<cacheinfo> file, assuming that the B<-blocks> argument to the
B<afsd> command was not used.

   % fs setcachesize -blocks 0
   % fs setcachesize -reset
