=head1 NAME

symlink - Introduction to the symlink command suite [Windows only]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<symlink> command creates, lists and removes Unix-style symbolic links
(symlinks) in OpenAFS filespace from a platform that does not support
symlinks, like Windows.  The L<B<symlink make>|symlink_make(1)> command is
equivalent to C<ln -s> on a Unix platform.  B<symlink> can manipulate
symlinks created by C<ln -s> on Unix and vice versa.

=head1 CAUTIONS

The B<symlink> commands are only available on Windows platforms.  On
other platforms, use the C<ln -s> command.
