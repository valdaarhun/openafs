=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<backup help> command displays the complete online help entry (short
description and syntax statement) for each operation code specified by the
B<-topic> argument. If the B<-topic> argument is omitted, the output
includes the first line (name and short description) of the online help
entry for every B<backup> command.

To list every backup command whose name or short description includes a
specified keyword, use the B<backup apropos> command.

=item B<-topic> <I<help string>>+

Indicates each command for which to display the complete online help
entry. Omit the B<backup> part of the command name, providing only the
operation code (for example, specify B<dump>, not B<backup dump>). If this
argument is omitted, the output briefly describes every B<backup> command.

=item B<-help>

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are
ignored.
