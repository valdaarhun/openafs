=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<kas list> command either displays all entries from the
Authentication Database by name, or displays the full database entry for a
defined set of entries, as determined by the flag provided:

=over 4

=item *

To display every entry in the Authentication Database in full, include the
B<-long> flag.

=item *

To display only those entries in full that have the C<ADMIN> flag set,
include the B<-showadmin> flag.

=item *

To list only the name of each Authentication Database entry, omit both the
B<-long> and B<-showadmin> flags.

=back

By default, full entries include a checksum for the encryption key, rather
than the actual octal digits that constitute the key. To display the octal
digits, include the B<-showkey> flag with the B<-long> or B<-showadmin>
flag.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-long>

Displays every Authentication Database entry in full. Provide this flag or
the B<-showadmin> flag, or omit both to display just the name of every
database entry.

=item B<-showadmin>

Displays in full only the Authentication Database entries that have the
C<ADMIN> flag set. Provide this flag or the B<-long> flag, or omit both to
display just the name of every database entry.

=item B<-showkey>

Displays the octal digits that constitute the key in each full
entry. Provide either the B<-long> or B<-showadmin> flag along with this
one.

=item B<-admin_username> <I<admin principal>>

Specifies the user identity under which to authenticate with the
Authentication Server for execution of the command. For more details, see
L<kas(8)>.

=item B<-password_for_admin> <I<admin password>>

Specifies the password of the command's issuer. If it is omitted (as
recommended), the B<kas> command interpreter prompts for it and does not
echo it visibly. For more details, see L<kas(8)>.

=item B<-cell> <I<cell name>>

Names the cell in which to run the command. For more details, see
L<kas(8)>.

=item B<-servers> <I<authentication servers>>+

Names each machine running an Authentication Server with which to
establish a connection. For more details, see L<kas(8)>.

=item B<-noauth>

Assigns the unprivileged identity C<anonymous> to the issuer. For more
details, see L<kas(8)>.

=item B<-help>

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are
ignored.

=back

=head1 OUTPUT

If neither the B<-long> or B<-showadmin> flag is provided, the output
lists the name of each entry in the Authentication Database on its own
line.

If the B<-long> flag is included, the output includes every Authentication
Database entry in full. If the B<-showadmin> flag is included, the output
includes in full only the Authentication Database entries that have the
C<ADMIN> flag set. If the B<-showkey> is provided along with either one,
the output includes the octal digits that constitute the encryption key in
each entry.

A full Authentication Database entry includes the same information
displayed by the B<kas examine> command; for details, see that command's
reference page.

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

The issuer must have the C<ADMIN> flag set on his or her Authentication
Database entry.
