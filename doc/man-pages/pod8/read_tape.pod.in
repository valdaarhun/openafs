=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<read_tape> reads an OpenAFS backup tape and prompts for each dump file to
save.  This command does not require any OpenAFS infrastructure.  This
command does not need an OpenAFS client or server to be available, which is
not the case with the L<backup(8)> command.

The dump files will be named for the Read/Write name of the volume restored.
After saving each dump file, B<vos restore> or B<restorevol> can be used to
restore the volume into AFS and non-AFS space respectively.

B<read_tape> reads the tape while skipping the specified number of volumes.
After that, it restores the specified number of volumes.  B<read_tape>
doesn't rewind the tape so that it may be used multiple times in succession.
