<div class="synopsis">

B<backup volinfo> S<<< B<-volume> <I<volume name>> >>> [B<-localauth>]
    S<<< [B<-cell> <I<cell name>>] >>> [B<-help>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<backup volinfo> command displays a dump history of the specified
volume, reporting information such as the date on which the volume was
dumped and the tapes that contain it. Include the C<.backup> extension on
the volume name if the backup version of the volume was dumped.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-volume> <I<volume name>>

Names the volume for which to display the dump history. Include the
C<.backup> or C<.readonly> extension if the backup or read-only version of
the volume was dumped.

=item B<-localauth>

Constructs a server ticket using a key from the local
F</usr/afs/etc/KeyFile> file. The B<backup> command interpreter presents
it to the Backup Server, Volume Server and VL Server during mutual
authentication. Do not combine this flag with the B<-cell> argument. For
more details, see L<backup(8)>.

=item B<-cell> <I<cell name>>

Names the cell in which to run the command. Do not combine this argument
with the B<-localauth> flag. For more details, see L<backup(8)>.

=item B<-help>

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are
ignored.

=head1 OUTPUT

The output includes a line for each Backup Database dump record that
mentions the specified volume, order from most to least recent. The output
for each record appears in a table with six columns:

=over 4

=item dumpID

The dump ID of the dump that includes the volume.

=item lvl

The depth in the dump hierarchy of the dump level at which the volume was
dumped. A value of C<0> indicates a full dump. A value of C<1> or greater
indicates an incremental dump made at the specified depth in the dump
hierarchy.

=item parentid

The dump ID of the dump's parent dump. A value of C<0> indicates a full
dump, which has no parent; in this case, the value in the C<lvl> column is
also C<0>.

=item creation date

The date and time at which the Backup System started the dump operation
that created the dump.

=item clone date

For a backup or read-only volume, the time at which it was cloned from its
read/write source. For a read/write volume, the same as the value in the
C<creation date> field.

=item tape name

The name of the tape containing the dump: either the permanent tape name,
or an AFS tape name in the format
I<volume_set_name>.I<dump_level_name>.I<tape_index> where
I<volume_set_name> is the name of the volume set associated with the
initial dump in the dump set of which this tape is a part;
I<dump_level_name> is the name of the dump level at which the initial dump
was backed up; I<tape_index> is the ordinal of the tape in the dump
set. Either type of name can be followed by a dump ID in parentheses; if
it appears, it is the dump ID of the initial dump in the dump set to which
this appended dump belongs.

The following example shows part of the dump history of the Backup volume
C<user.smith.backup>:
