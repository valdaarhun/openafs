=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<backup status> command displays which operation, if any, the
indicated Tape Coordinator is currently executing.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-portoffset> <I<TC port offset>>

Specifies the port offset number of the Tape Coordinator for which to
report the status.

=item B<-localauth>

Constructs a server ticket using a key from the local
F</usr/afs/etc/KeyFile> file. The B<backup> command interpreter presents
it to the Backup Server, Volume Server and VL Server during mutual
authentication. Do not combine this flag with the B<-cell> argument. For
more details, see L<backup(8)>.

=item B<-cell> <I<cell name>>

Names the cell in which to run the command. Do not combine this argument
with the B<-localauth> flag. For more details, see L<backup(8)>.

=item B<-help>

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are
ignored.

=back

=head1 OUTPUT

The following message indicates that the Tape Coordinator is not currently
performing an operation:

   Tape coordinator is idle

Otherwise, the output includes a message of the following format for each
running or pending operation:

   Task <task_ID>:  <operation>:   <status>

where

=over 4

=item <task_ID>

Is a task identification number assigned by the Tape Coordinator.  It
begins with the Tape Coordinator's port offset number.

=item <operation>

Identifies the operation the Tape Coordinator is performing, which is
initiated by the indicated command:

=over 4

=item Dump

The B<backup dump> command.

=item Restore

The B<backup diskrestore>, B<backup volrestore>, or B<backup
volsetrestore> commands.

=item Labeltape

The B<backup labeltape> command.

=item Scantape

The B<backup scantape> command.

=item SaveDb

The B<backup savedb> command.

=item RestoreDb

The B<backup restoredb> command.

=back

=item <status>

Indicates the job's current status in one of the following messages.

=over 4

=item I<number> Kbytes transferred, volume I<volume_name>

For a running dump operation, indicates the number of kilobytes copied to
tape or a backup data file so far, and the volume currently being dumped.

=item I<number> Kbytes, restore.volume

For a running restore operation, indicates the number of kilobytes copied
into AFS from a tape or a backup data file so far.

=item [abort requested]

The B<backup kill> command was issued, but the termination signal has yet
to reach the Tape Coordinator.

=item [abort sent]

The operation is canceled by the B<backup kill> command.  Once the Backup
System removes an operation from the queue or stops it from running, it no
longer appears at all in the output from the command.

=item [butc contact lost]

The B<backup> command interpreter cannot reach the Tape Coordinator. The
message can mean either that the Tape Coordinator handling the operation
was terminated or failed while the operation was running, or that the
connection to the Tape Coordinator timed out.

=item [done]

The Tape Coordinator has finished the operation.

=item [drive wait]

The operation is waiting for the specified tape drive to become free.

=item [operator wait]

The Tape Coordinator is waiting for the backup operator to insert a tape
in the drive.

=back

=back

If the Tape Coordinator is communicating with an XBSA server (a
third-party backup utility that implements the Open Group's Backup Service
API [XBSA]), the following message appears last in the output:

   <XBSA_program> Tape coordinator

where <XBSA_program> is the name of the XBSA-compliant program.

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following example shows that the Tape Coordinator with port offset 4
has so far dumped about 1.5 MB of data for the current dump operation, and
is currently dumping the volume named C<user.pat.backup>:

   % backup status -portoffset 4
   Task 4001:  Dump:   1520 Kbytes transferred,  volume user.pat.backup

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

The issuer must be listed in the F</usr/afs/etc/UserList> file on every
machine where the Backup Server is running, or must be logged onto a
server machine as the local superuser C<root> if the B<-localauth> flag is
included.
