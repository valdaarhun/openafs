=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<backup delvolentry> command deletes the indicated volume entry from
the volume set specified with the B<-name> argument.  Use the B<-entry>
argument to identify the volume entry by its index number. To display the
index numbers, use the B<backup listvolsets> command.

If there are any remaining volume entries with index numbers higher than
the deleted entry, their indexes are automatically decremented to
eliminate any gaps in the indexing sequence.

=head1 CAUTIONS

Deleting volume entries from a temporary volume set is possible only
within the interactive session in which the volume set was created.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-name> <I<volume set name>>

Names the volume set from which to delete a volume entry.

=item B<-entry> <I<volume set index>>

Specifies the index number of the volume entry to delete. Use the B<backup
listvolsets> command to display the index numbers for a volume set's
volume entries.

=item B<-localauth>

Constructs a server ticket using a key from the local
F</usr/afs/etc/KeyFile> file. The B<backup> command interpreter presents
it to the Backup Server, Volume Server and VL Server during mutual
authentication. Do not combine this flag with the B<-cell> argument. For
more details, see L<backup(8)>.

=item B<-cell> <I<cell name>>

Names the cell in which to run the command. Do not combine this argument
with the B<-localauth> flag. For more details, see L<backup(8)>.

=item B<-help>

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are
ignored.

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following command deletes the fourth volume entry from the volume set
called C<sys>:

   % backup delvolentry -name sys -entry 4

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

The issuer must be listed in the F</usr/afs/etc/UserList> file on every
machine where the Backup Server is running, or must be logged onto a
server machine as the local superuser C<root> if the B<-localauth> flag is
included.
