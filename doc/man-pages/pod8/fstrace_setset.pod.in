=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<fstrace setset> command sets the status of the C<cm> kernel event
set on the local machine, which determines whether trace messages are
recorded in the log buffer in kernel memory.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-set> <I<set name>>+

Names the event set for which to set the status. The only acceptable value
C<cm>, which is also the default if this argument is omitted.

=item B<-active>

Enables tracing for the event set and allocates kernel memory for the
associated trace log buffer. Provide one of this flag, the B<-inactive>
flag, or the B<-dormant> flag.

=item B<-inactive>

Temporarily disables tracing for the event set, but does not change the
allocation of kernel memory for the associated trace log buffer.  Provide
one of this flag, the B<-active> flag, or the B<-dormant> flag.

=item B<-dormant>

Disables tracing for the event set and frees the kernel memory previously
allocated for the associated trace log buffer. Provide one of this flag,
the B<-active> flag, or the B<-inactive> flag.

=item B<-help>

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are
ignored.
