=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<backup dumpinfo> command formats and displays the Backup Database
record for the specified dumps. To specify how many of the most recent
dumps to display, starting with the newest one and going back in time, use
the B<-ndumps> argument. To display more detailed information about a
single dump, use the B<-id> argument. To display the records for the 10
most recent dumps, omit both the B<-ndumps> and B<-id> arguments.

The B<-verbose> flag produces very detailed information that is useful
mostly for debugging purposes. It can be combined only with the B<-id>
argument.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-ndumps> <I<number of dumps>>

Displays the Backup Database record for each of the specified number of
dumps that were most recently performed. If the database contains fewer
dumps than are requested, the output includes the records for all existing
dumps. Do not combine this argument with the B<-id> or B<-verbose>
options; omit all options to display the records for the last 10 dumps.

=item B<-id> <I<dump id>>

Specifies the dump ID number of a single dump for which to display the
Backup Database record. Precede the I<dump id> value with the B<-id>
switch; otherwise, the command interpreter interprets it as the value of
the B<-ndumps> argument. Combine this argument with the B<-verbose> flag,
but not with the B<-ndumps> argument; omit all options to display the
records for the last 10 dumps.

=item B<-verbose>

Provides more detailed information about the dump specified with the
B<-id> argument, which must be provided along with it. Do not combine this
flag with the B<-ndumps> argument.

=item B<-localauth>

Constructs a server ticket using a key from the local
F</usr/afs/etc/KeyFile> file. The B<backup> command interpreter presents
it to the Backup Server, Volume Server and VL Server during mutual
authentication. Do not combine this flag with the B<-cell> argument. For
more details, see L<backup(8)>.

=item B<-cell> <I<cell name>>

Names the cell in which to run the command. Do not combine this argument
with the B<-localauth> flag. For more details, see L<backup(8)>.

=item B<-help>

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are
ignored.

=back

=head1 OUTPUT

If the B<-ndumps> argument is provided, the output presents the following
information in table form, with a separate line for each dump:

=over 4

=item dumpid

The dump ID number.

=item parentid

The dump ID number of the dump's parent dump. A value of C<0> (zero)
identifies a full dump.

=item lv

The depth in the dump hierarchy of the dump level used to create the
dump. A value of C<0> (zero) identifies a full dump, in which case the
value in the C<parentid> field is also C<0>. A value of C<1> or greater
indicates an incremental dump made at the corresponding level in the dump
hierarchy.

=item created

The date and time at which the Backup System started the dump operation
that created the dump.

=item nt

The number of tapes that contain the data in the dump. A value of C<0>
(zero) indicates that the dump operation was terminated or failed. Use the
B<backup deletedump> command to remove such entries.

=item nvols

The number of volumes from which the dump includes data. If a volume spans
tapes, it is counted twice. A value of C<0> (zero) indicates that the dump
operation was terminated or failed; the value in the C<nt> field is also
C<0> in this case.

=item dump name

The dump name in the form

   <volume_set_name>.<dump_level_name> (<initial_dump_ID>)

where <volume_set_name> is the name of the volume set, and
<dump_level_name> is the last element in the dump level pathname at which
the volume set was dumped.

The <initial_dump_ID>, if displayed, is the dump ID of the initial dump in
the dump set to which this dump belongs. If there is no value in
parentheses, the dump is the initial dump in a dump set that has no
appended dumps.

=back

If the B<-id> argument is provided alone, the first line of output begins
with the string C<Dump> and reports information for the entire dump in the
following fields:

=over 4

=item id

The dump ID number.

=item level

The depth in the dump hierarchy of the dump level used to create the
dump. A value of C<0> (zero) identifies a full dump. A value of C<1> (one)
or greater indicates an incremental dump made at the specified level in
the dump hierarchy.

=item volumes

The number of volumes for which the dump includes data.

=item created

The date and time at which the dump operation began.

=back

If an XBSA server was the backup medium for the dump (rather than a tape
device or backup data file), the following line appears next:

   Backup Service: <XBSA_program>: Server: <hostname>

where <XBSA_program> is the name of the XBSA-compliant program and
<hostname> is the name of the machine on which the program runs.

Next the output includes an entry for each tape that houses volume data
from the dump. Following the string C<Tape>, the first two lines of each
entry report information about that tape in the following fields:

=over 4

=item name

The tape's permanent name if it has one, or its AFS tape name otherwise,
and its tape ID number in parentheses.

=item nVolumes

The number of volumes for which this tape includes dump data.

=item created

The date and time at which the Tape Coordinator began writing data to this
tape.

=back

Following another blank line, the tape-specific information concludes with
a table that includes a line for each volume dump on the tape. The
information appears in columns with the following headings:

=over 4

=item Pos

The relative position of each volume in this tape or file. On a tape, the
counter begins at position 2 (the tape label occupies position 1), and
increments by one for each volume. For volumes in a backup data file, the
position numbers start with 1 and do not usually increment only by one,
because each is the ordinal of the 16 KB offset in the file at which the
volume's data begins. The difference between the position numbers
therefore indicates how many 16 KB blocks each volume's data occupies. For
example, if the second volume is at position 5 and the third volume in the
list is at position 9, that means that the dump of the second volume
occupies 64 KB (four 16-KB blocks) of space in the file.

=item Clone time

For a backup or read-only volume, the time at which it was cloned from its
read/write source. For a Read/Write volume, it is the same as the dump
creation date reported on the first line of the output.

=item Nbytes

The number of bytes of data in the dump of the volume.

=item Volume

The volume name, complete with C<.backup> or C<.readonly> extension if
appropriate.

=back

If both the B<-id> and B<-verbose> options are provided, the output is
divided into several sections:

=over 4

=item *

The first section, headed by the underlined string C<Dump>, includes
information about the entire dump. The fields labeled C<id>, C<level>,
C<created>, and C<nVolumes> report the same values (though in a different
order) as appear on the first line of output when the B<-id> argument is
provided by itself.  Other fields of potential interest to the backup
operator are:

=over 4

=item Group id

The dump's I<group ID number>, which is recorded in the dump's Backup
Database record if the C<GROUPID> instruction appears in the Tape
Coordinator's F</usr/afs/backup/CFG_I<tcid>> file when the dump is
created.

=item maxTapes

The number of tapes that contain the dump set to which this dump belongs.

=item Start Tape Seq

The ordinal of the tape on which this dump begins in the set of tapes that
contain the dump set.

=back

=item *

For each tape that contains data from this dump, there follows a section
headed by the underlined string C<Tape>. The fields labeled C<name>,
C<written>, and C<nVolumes> report the same values (though in a different
order) as appear on the second and third lines of output when the B<-id>
argument is provided by itself. Other fields of potential interest to the
backup operator are:

=over 4

=item expires

The date and time when this tape can be recycled, because all dumps it
contains have expired.

=item nMBytes Data and nBytes Data

Summed together, these fields represent the total amount of dumped data
actually from volumes (as opposed to labels, filemarks, and other
markers).

=item KBytes Tape Used

The number of kilobytes of tape (or disk space, for a backup data file)
used to store the dump data. It is generally larger than the sum of the
values in the C<nMBytes Data> and C<nBytes Data> fields, because it
includes the space required for the label, file marks and other markers,
and because the Backup System writes data at 16 KB offsets, even if the
data in a given block doesn't fill the entire 16 KB.

=back

=item *

For each volume on a given tape, there follows a section headed by the
underlined string C<Volume>. The fields labeled C<name>, C<position>,
C<clone>, and C<nBytes> report the same values (though in a different
order) as appear in the table that lists the volumes in each tape when the
B<-id> argument is provided by itself. Other fields of potential interest
to the backup operator are:

=over 4

=item id

The volume ID.

=item tape

The name of the tape containing this volume data.

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following example displays information about the last five dumps:

   % backup dumpinfo -ndumps 5
      dumpid   parentid lv created          nt nvols dump name
   924424000          0 0  04/18/1999 04:26  1    22 usr.sun (924424000)
   924685000  924424000 1  04/21/1999 04:56  1    62 usr.wed (924424000)
   924773000  924424000 1  04/22/1999 05:23  1    46 usr.thu (924424000)
   924860000  924424000 1  04/23/1999 05:33  1    58 usr.fri (924424000)
   925033000          0 0  04/25/1999 05:36  2    73 sys.week

The following example displays a more detailed record for a single dump.

   % backup dumpinfo -id 922097346
   Dump: id 922097346, level 0, volumes 1, created Mon Mar 22 05:09:06 1999
   Tape: name monday.user.backup (922097346)
   nVolumes 1, created 03/22/1999 05:09
    Pos       Clone time   Nbytes Volume
      1 03/22/1999 04:43 27787914 user.pat.backup

The following example displays even more detailed information about the
dump displayed in the previous example (dump ID 922097346). This example
includes only one exemplar of each type of section (C<Dump>, C<Tape>, and
C<Volume>):

   % backup dumpinfo -id 922097346 -verbose
