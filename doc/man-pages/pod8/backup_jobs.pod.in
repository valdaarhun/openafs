=head1 NAME

backup_jobs - Lists pending and running operations in interactive mode

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=for html
<div class="synopsis">

B<jobs> [B<-help>]

B<j> [B<-h>]

=for html
</div>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<backup jobs> command lists the job ID number and status of each
B<backup> operation running or pending in the current interactive session.

This command can be issued in interactive mode only. If the issuer of the
B<backup interactive> command included the B<-localauth> flag, the
B<-cell> argument, or both, those settings apply to this command also.

To terminate operations that appear in the output, issue the B<backup
kill> command and identify the operation to cancel with the job ID number
from this command's output.

To check the status of a Tape Coordinator, rather than of a certain
operation, use the B<backup status> command.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-help>

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are
ignored.

=back

=head1 OUTPUT

The output always includes the expiration date and time of the tokens that
the B<backup> command interpreter is using during the current interactive
session, in the following format:

   <date>   <time>: TOKEN EXPIRATION

If the execution date and time specified for a scheduled dump operation is
later than <date time>, then its individual line (as described in the
following paragraphs) appears below this line to indicate that the current
tokens will not be available to it.

If the issuer of the backup command included the B<-localauth> flag when
entering interactive mode, the line instead reads as follows:

   :  TOKEN NEVER EXPIRES

The entry for a scheduled dump operation has the following format:

   Job <job_ID>:  <timestamp>:  dump  <volume_set>  <dump_level>

where

=over 4

=item <job_ID>

Is a job identification number assigned by the Backup System.

=item <timestamp>

Indicates the date and time the dump operation is to begin, in the format
I<month>/I<date>/I<year> I<hours>:I<minutes> (in 24-hour format)

=item <volume_set>

Indicates the volume set to dump.

=item <dump_level>

Indicates the dump level at which to perform the dump operation.

=back

The line for a pending or running operation of any other type has the
following format:

   Job <job_ID>:  <operation>  <status>

where

=over 4

=item <job_ID>

Is a job identification number assigned by the Backup System.

=item <operation>

Identifies the operation the Tape Coordinator is performing, which is
initiated by the indicated command:

=over 4

=item Dump (I<dump name>)

Initiated by the backup dump command. The I<dump name> has the following
format:

    <volume_set_name>.<dump_level_name>

=item Restore

Initiated by the B<backup diskrestore>, B<backup volrestore>, or B<backup
volsetrestore> command.

=item Labeltape (I<tape_label>)

Initiated by the B<backup labeltape>n command. The I<tape_label> is the
name specified by the B<backup labeltape> command's B<-name> or B<-pname>
argument.

=item Scantape

Initiated by the B<backup scantape> command.

=item SaveDb

Initiated by the B<backup savedb> command.

=item RestoreDb

Initiated by the B<backup restoredb> command.

=back

=item <status>

Indicates the job's current status in one of the following messages. If no
message appears, the job is either still pending or has finished.

=over 4

=item I<number> Kbytes, volume I<volume_name>

For a running dump operation, indicates the number of kilobytes copied to
tape or a backup data file so far, and the volume currently being dumped.

=item I<number> Kbytes, restore.volume

For a running restore operation, indicates the number of kilobytes copied
into AFS from a tape or a backup data file so far.

=item [abort requested]

The B<backup kill> command was issued, but the termination signal has yet
to reach the Tape Coordinator.

=item [abort sent]

The operation is canceled by the B<backup kill> command.  Once the Backup
System removes an operation from the queue or stops it from running, it no
longer appears at all in the output from the command.

=item [butc contact lost]

The backup command interpreter cannot reach the Tape Coordinator. The
message can mean either that the Tape Coordinator handling the operation
was terminated or failed while the operation was running, or that the
connection to the Tape Coordinator timed out.

=item [done]

The Tape Coordinator has finished the operation.

=item [drive wait]

The operation is waiting for the specified tape drive to become free.

=item [operator wait]

The Tape Coordinator is waiting for the backup operator to insert a tape
in the drive.

=back

=back

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following example shows that two restore operations and one dump
operation are running (presumably on different Tape Coordinators) and that
the B<backup> command interpreter's tokens expire on 22 April 1999 at
10:45 am:

   backup> jobs
   Job 1: Restore, 1306 Kbytes, restore.volume
   Job 2: Dump (user.sunday1), 34 Kbytes, volume user.pat.backup
   Job 3: Restore, 2498 Kbytes, restore.volume
          04/22/1999 10:45: TOKEN EXPIRATION

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

None. However, queuing any operation requires privilege, and it is
possible to issue this command only within the interactive session in
which the jobs are queued.
