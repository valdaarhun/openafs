=head1 NAME

backup_interactive - Enters interactive mode

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=for html
<div class="synopsis">

B<backup> [B<interactive>] [B<-localauth>] S<<< [B<-cell> <I<cell name>>] >>>
    [B<-help>]

B<backup> [B<i>] [B<-l>] S<<< [B<-c> <I<cell name>>] >>> [B<-h>]

=for html
</div>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<backup interactive> initiates an interactive session for issuing
B<backup> commands. As indicated in the syntax statement, the operation
code (B<interactive>) is optional.

Several features of interactive mode distinguish it from regular mode:

=over 4

=item *

In interactive mode, the C<backup>> prompt replaces the system (shell)
prompt. The operator enters only a command's operation code (omitting the
command suite name, B<backup>).

=item *

If the B<-localauth> flag or the B<-cell> argument is included on the
B<backup interactive> command, the settings apply to all commands issued
during that interactive session. The issuer does not need to type them on
every command. Another consequence is that the flag and argument do not
appear in the syntax statement generated by the B<help> subcommand or
B<-help> flag on an individual command issued at the C<backup>> prompt.

=item *

The B<backup jobs> and B<backup kill> commands are available only in
interactive mode. It is not possible to track and terminate backup
operations as cleanly in non-interactive mode.

=item *

It is not necessary to enclose strings that include metacharacters in
double quotes or other delimiters.

=item *

The backup command interpreter establishes a connection to the Backup
Server, Volume Server and Volume Location (VL) Server processes as it
enters interactive mode, and uses the same connection for all commands
during the session. Execution time can therefore be faster than in
non-interactive mode, in which the command interpreter must establish a
new connection for each command.

=back

To exit an interactive session, issue the B<backup quit> command.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-localauth>

Constructs a server ticket using a key from the local
F</usr/afs/etc/KeyFile> file. The B<backup> command interpreter presents
it to the Backup Server, Volume Server and VL Server during mutual
authentication. Do not combine this flag with the B<-cell> argument. For
more details, see L<backup(8)>.

=item B<-cell> <I<cell name>>

Names the cell in which to run the command. Do not combine this argument
with the B<-localauth> flag. For more details, see L<backup(8)>.

=item B<-help>

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are
ignored.

=back

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following example shows how the B<-localauth> flag and B<-cell>
argument do not appear when the B<help dump> subcommand is issued in
interactive mode.

   % backup
   backup> help dump
   dump: start dump
   Usage: dump [-volumeset <volume set name>] [-dump <dump level name>]
   [-portoffset <TC port offset>] [-at <Date/time to start dump>+]
   [-append ] [-n ] [-file <load file>] [-help ]

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

None. However, B<backup> commands that require privilege in regular mode
still require it in interactive mode.
